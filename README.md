# Js
I'm trying to make a game using JavaScipt Html-Canvas
I'm still learning JavaScript so I may follow some youtube steps, but of course I will add my lines on it, because learning It's not just copy and paste.

UPDATE : I start making characters mooving :D yeeeyy 

Update (12-09-2023) : They are fighting ehehe, still got some problem but I will fix it later, I will add health bar later Inchaalah.

Update (12-11-2023) : I added health bar and they re getting damaged. Next I need to add "Timer" and "Game Over"

Update (12-12-2023) : I have a problem that when the timer goes to 0 the display not changing to flex so it shows tie when both enemy and player are full hp.
                      - I tried to rename it and use style on html
